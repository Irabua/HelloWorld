# A Little Insight into Irabua
Hi everyone. My name is Nicholas Mwirabua. This README file will give a little insight about me!

# My Career Passions.
I really love working in the tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can work with others to build something amazing! Whether that's being a team leader, a team member, working with customers or relaying information to developers, that's my sweet spot! I enjoy learning new things and serving people around me, so any role that enables me to flex my education and servanthood muscles is the right role for me!
# My Hobbies
One of my favourite things to do is to play handball - you find me bored, place the ball on my hand and ill be a disturbed hummingbird!
